# Secret APIs

TT3 has many other APIs available; however, they are not public-facing. You can still use them, but they will not be documented here and may be subject to breaking changes at any time. In general, you will find the most useful APIs in certain items and interactables, to interface with them.

If you're interested, feel free to poke around and see what you can find!
