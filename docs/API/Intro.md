# Intro

The public API is a collection of functions that you can use to access and modify the game state. It is accessible from maps, gamemodes, and other scripts within.

This section will cover the available APIs, their usage, and any important details. Additionally, you should note that certain APIs are only available from the client or from the server. This is indicated on the API page.

Finally, if something seems awkward to use (e.g, an API that is only available on the server / client that would be very useful on both), let me know! Chances are I simply haven't had time to implement it in a nicer way yet.
