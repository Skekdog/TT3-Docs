# RoleDefinition

Roles are... well they're roles. Gamemodes can define roles and specify them in the `Roles` field of the `GamemodeDefinition`.

## Properties

### Kind

`Type: "RoleDefinition"`

Always set to "RoleDefinition". Used to differentiate between classes.

### Name

`Type: string`

The internal name of the role. This should match the key used in the `Roles` field of the `GamemodeDefinition`.

### DisplayName

`Type: string?`

The display name of the role. If not set, the name will be used as the display name.

### Description

`Type: string`

The description of the role. This is shown as a hint when a player is assigned this role.

### Color

`Type: Color3`

The color of the role. This is used to color the role in the UI.

### Sound

`Type: string`

The asset string (`rbxassetid://123`) for the sound that will play when this role is selected.

### IsExclamatory

`Type: boolean?`

If true, mentions of this role will have an exclamation mark where appropriate. Additionally, the number of exclamatory roles is announced when the round begins. And also players assigned an exclamatory role will receive a list of their comrades when the round begins.

Yes this property does a lot. I'll make it more granular in the future.

### PluralName

`Type: string?`

The plural form of the role name. If not set, the singular name will be used, with an "s" appended to the end.

### IsEvil

`Type: boolean?`

If true, this role is evil. Gamemodes and maps often use this to determine whether a player should have be allowed to do certain actions.

:::note

This does **not** mean that a role is freely killable.
