# MeleeWeaponDefinition

`MeleeWeaponDefinition` defines a melee weapon.

:::note

:::

## Properties

### Kind

`Type: "Melee"`

Always set to "Melee". Used to differentiate between classes.

### AlternateToggled

### AttackAnimation

`Type: string`

An asset string for the attack animation of the weapon.

### AttackInterval

All melees are "automatic" - players can simply hold down the mouse button to fire.

:::

The sound to play when the melee is used.

### Damage

`Type: DamageInfo`

The damage that the melee deals.

### MaxDistance
