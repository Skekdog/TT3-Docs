Guns inherit from `CommonWeaponDefinition`; you can also specify those properties.

:::

## Properties

### Kind

`Type: "Gun"`

Always set to "Gun". Used to differentiate between classes.

An asset string for the aim animation of the weapon.

:::note

:::

### ReloadTime

`Type: number`

The time (in seconds) it takes to reload the gun. Set to `0` for instant reloading.

`Type: number`

The time (in seconds) between firing.

:::note

All guns are "automatic" - players can simply hold down the mouse button to fire.

:::

### AttackSound

`Type: Sound?`

The sound to play when the gun is fired.

### ReloadSound

`Type: Sound?`

The sound to play when the gun is reloaded.

:::note

Currently, reload sounds only play on the client.

:::

### Damage

`Type: DamageInfo`

The damage that the gun deals.

### AmmoType

`Type: AmmoDefinition`

The ammo type that the gun uses.

### IsSilent

`Type: boolean?`

If true, the gun is a silent weapon. Damage indicators will not be shown, and no death sound will be played. Additionally, near-miss self defense will not apply.

### AimFOV

`Type: number?`

The field of view to set when aiming. If `nil`, FOV will not change.

### HasScope

`Type: boolean?`

If true, aiming will show a scope.

### ScopeRequired

`Type: boolean?`

If true, the gun cannot be fired when not scoped in.

### HasMuzzleFlash

`Type: boolean?`

If true, a muzzle flash will be shown when the gun is fired. The gun model must have a child "MuzzleFlash" `Attachment`, at the centre of the muzzle flash location.

### AimSpreadMultiplier

`Type: number?`

A multiplier applied to the spread when aiming. If `nil`, spread will not change.

### LaserColor

`Type: Color3?`

The speed, in studs per second, of the projectile. Defaults to `100`.

### BulletsPerShot

`Type: number?`

The number of bullets fired per shot. Defaults to `1`. This can be used to create shotguns.

### Spread
