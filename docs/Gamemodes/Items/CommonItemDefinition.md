# CommonItemDefinition

`CommonItemDefinition` is the base definition for all item definitions. It contains the basic information for the item. All item definitions include these properties and functions.

## Properties

### Name

`Type: string`

The internal name of the item.

### DisplayName

`Type: string?`

The display name of the item. If not set, the name will be used as the display name.

### Description

`Type: string?`

The description of the item. This must be set if this item will appear in the shop.

### Icon

`Type: string?`

An asset string for the icon of the item. This must be set if this item will appear in the shop.

### IsPixelIcon

`Type: boolean?`

If true, the icon displayed will have `ImageLabel.ResampleMode` set to `Pixelated`.

### CreditCost

`Type: number?`

The cost, in credits, of this item. This must be set if this item will appear in the shop.

### MaxStock

`Type: number?`

The maximum number of times that a single player can purchase this item. If `nil`, there is no limit.

### IsEvilItem

`Type: boolean?`

If true, this item will make non-evil players a free kill when they have it equipped.

### ItemGroup

`Type: { PreferredSlot: number? }`

The group that this item belongs to. Only one item from a group can be present in an inventory at a time. If `nil`, this item is passive and not part of any group. Item groups are denoted by the specific table reference, not PreferredSlot. You must use the same table when defining the item group.

See also: [`API.StandardGame#ItemGroups`](/API/StandardGame#itemgroups).

```lua
local item: Types.ItemDefinition = {
	...,
	ItemGroup = StandardGame.ItemGroups.RoleUtility,
	...,
}
```
