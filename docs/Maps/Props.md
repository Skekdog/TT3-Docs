# Props

Most maps will want to have props - props are thing that players can grab with the Magneto Stick, that can (or cannot) be destroyed, and that can (or cannot) be moved around. Props can have special behaviour when taking damage, or when destroyed.

## Making a Prop

Props can take two forms: a single `BasePart`, or a `Model`. In either case, you must add the `Prop` tag to the `BasePart` or `Model` to make it a prop.
