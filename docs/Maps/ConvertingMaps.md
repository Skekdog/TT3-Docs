# Converting Maps from TT2

TT2 maps can be converted to the Traitor! format using the [TTTTTTT Plugin](https://github.com/Skekdog/TTTTTTT). Maps converted in this way will have all geometry converted, and some interactive components will also be converted, such as doors, ladders and interactables.

Heavily-scripted aspects of maps will likely be incompatible; however, there is some compatibility built-in for TT2 APIs.
