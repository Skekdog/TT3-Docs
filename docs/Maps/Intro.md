# Intro

Anyone can make a TT3 map! You don't need to know how to code to make a map, but if you do, maps can contain almost any custom behaviour, from tasks (like on Skeld), to TVs (like on hidden maps), to complete overhauls of the game.

This guide will assume you have some familiarity with Roblox Studio. If not, I would highly recommend learning that first. You can use the [Creator Docs](https://create.roblox.com/docs) to get started.
