# Loading your map or gamemode

See also: [Commands](/Commands.md).

Once you have the general structure of your map or gamemode down, you may want to playtest and see it in action.

To do this, you should use the Publish function of the TT3 SDK. Once published, you should configure the asset on the creator store - make sure it is distributed publically.

:::info

This will make your asset publically available; anyone will be able to download and use it.

:::

Once distributed, you can now load it in TT3. To do this, create a free private server in the [Labs](https://www.roblox.com/games/118757439615813/) game, and join it. Once you have joined, you will have access to a console, where you can run commands to host your server.

To load a map, use the command: `map AssetId`<br/>
To load a gamemode, use the command: `forcegamemode AssetId`
To see other commands, use the command: `help`

Now if everything has gone well, you will be able to play your map or gamemode!
