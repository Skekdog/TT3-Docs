Gamemodes define the rules and behaviors of the gameplay. They work in conjunction with maps to provide the entire game experience. Unlike maps, scripting ability is generally required to make complex gamemodes.

This section also covers features which can be used in maps too.

To start, you should install the [Traitor! SDK](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/107938745988414/) plugin. This plugin provides example gamemodes, API types, and the tools you need to successfully load your gamemode in-game.

If you are looking to create interactables, refer to [`Guides/Maps/Interactables#Defined-Interactables`](/Traitor-Docs/guides/maps/interactables#defined-interactables).
